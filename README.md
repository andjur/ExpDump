# ExpDump
Utility to scan exposure files (subs/subexposures) acquired during astro imaging sessions (.fits files) and stored on disk in specific folder structure containing short sessions descriptions containg info about imaged object and used equipment. This info (from folder and file names/file system paths) is extracted, normalized and exported to .csv file. This .csv file can be imported into Excel and used as data source for Pivot table/chart that allows digging in subs in desired way e.g. by date, integration time, object, telescope, camera, filter and various combinations.
